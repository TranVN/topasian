                            non-compliant supplier parts or late shipments could result in reduced
                            efficiency or loss of production, late customer deliveries and possible product
                            quality issues or recalls. Non-compliant supplier parts can profoundly affect an
                            organization’s bottom line.</span></p>
                    <p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Third-Party Audits are also referred to as
                            external or factory audits. The 3rd party audit is usually more formal than an
                            internal or 1st party audit. In some instances, the audit results could
                            influence future purchasing decisions. The audits may also respond to one or
                            more quality issues with the supplier’s parts or assemblies. There often is a
                            contract between the customer and supplier specifying the terms of delivery,
                            pricing, packaging, quality requirements and various additional terms. For this
                            reason, 3rd party audits are generally subject to rules and regulations
                            concerning contract law.</span></p>
