<p>In today’s globalized economy, businesses increasingly rely on manufacturers in other countries to produce their products. While this can provide many benefits, it can also create challenges when it comes to ensuring quality in production. This is where <strong>Sample Picking Service</strong> (SPS) comes in.<br>
    TOPASIA offers SPS to help clients assess whether their production meets their quality needs and market standards. SPS involves randomly selecting shipment or testing samples to prevent the factory from arranging the samples to represent the entire production lot. With TOPASIA, clients can be confident that the samples they receive are authentic and as per their specifications.</p>
    <h2><strong><span data-preserver-spaces="true">What is a Sample Picking Service?</span></strong></h2>
    <p>SPS aims to select cartons more randomly to gain accurate inspection results that reflect the actual quality of the production. TOPASIA has defined carton sealing procedures to identify which cartons were selected and sealed by us and which were re-packed and sealed by the factory. This helps clients evaluate our inspector(s) performance, mainly when any quality issue arises from the client.</p>
    <h2><strong><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Why Use a Sample Picking Service?</span></strong></h2>
    <p>Manufacturers usually work with highly skilled sample producers. It is essential to know exactly where your production samples come from to ensure you receive what you requested. Once the product goes into production, it may differ from the approved sample in various ways. Blindly trusting and supporting the samples sent to you by the factory can be risky as the final product may not reflect the actual production.<br>
    A complete sample review plan is the key to launching a new product or product line for your business. TOPASIA SPS ensures clients receive accurate and authentic samples reflecting their production. By avoiding potential quality issues, clients can reduce time spent and improve the efficiency for their business.</p>
    <h2><strong><span data-preserver-spaces="true">When do you Use Sample Picking Service?</span></strong></h2>
    <p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Sample-picking services can be used in a variety of situations. Quality control processes are the most common use case, as sample picking can help ensure that products or components meet specific standards or specifications. Compliance with regulations is another everyday use case, as some industries must test a certain percentage of their products for safety or efficacy. Other situations where sample-picking services may be helpful to include new product development, product line extensions, and supply chain management.</span></p>
    <h2><strong><span data-preserver-spaces="true">How to Choose a Sample Picking Service Provider</span></strong></h2>
    <p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">When choosing a sample-picking service provider, there are several factors to consider. First and foremost, you should look for a provider with a reputation for accuracy and reliability. It would be best if you also looked for a provider with experience in your specific industry, as this can help ensure that the samples selected are representative of the population. Communication and transparency are also vital factors to consider, as you should be able to communicate your needs and preferences with the provider easily.</span></p>
    <h2>How does TOPASIA perform&nbsp;carton sampling method?</h2>
    <p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">TOPASIA has a rigorous process for carton and defect sample stamping during inspections. The process involves several steps to ensure that the selected samples are accurately identified and protected:</span></p>
    <ol>
    <li><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The inspector identifies the selected cartons and records the carton number with a distinctive TOPASIA Inspection Sampling stamp if permitted by the factory. The inspector also checks the stamp whenever they leave the cartons or samples unattended.</span></li>
    <li><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Suppose the carton number must still be assigned on the export carton before the inspection. In that case, the inspector carefully checks the PO, Art./Style No# or some identification number or description marked on the carton to ensure it is correct. The inspector randomly selects the cartons and samples to protect TOPASIA interests.</span></li>
    <li><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The TOPASIA Inspection Sampling stamp is applied to the gummed tapes and cartons to make it easy for inspectors to detect when any cartons were re-opened or re-sealed before the inspection.</span></li>
    <li><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The inspector ensures that the factory worker does not change or remove the selected samples, such as unpacking the goods.</span></li>
    <li><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Inspectors accompany factory workers to transit the selected cartons from the selection area/warehouse to the inspection site. Suppose the inspection situation does not allow the inspector to attend the transit process. In that case, they re-check the carton number and significant stamp on the cartons to ensure that the correct goods were selected.</span></li>
    <li><span data-preserver-spaces="true">During the inspection, defects are identified by an arrow sticker/clip or specific indicator and segregated from the good samples.</span></li>
    <li><span data-preserver-spaces="true">If defect samples are drawn for the applicant’s decision, the type of defects is described on the TOPASIA defective sticker and attached to the goods or packing materials. The defect samples are protected against any deterioration during transportation.</span></li>
    </ol>
    <p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">By following this process, TOPASIA ensures that the selected samples are accurately identified and protected during the inspection. Contact our team for more information.</span></p>
